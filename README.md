# Student_Performance_Clustering
KMeans clustering of student performance data with dimensionality reduction using PCA and t-SNE for visualization.
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze and group students based on academic performance and behavioral attributes. It uses **KMeans clustering** to identify performance-based groups and applies **PCA** and **t-SNE** for dimensionality reduction and visual exploration.

##Techniques Used
- KMeans Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
- Silhouette Score Evaluation

## Dataset Features
- Hours Studied
- Previous Scores
- Extracurricular Activities
- Sleep Hours
- Sample Question Papers Practiced
- Performance Index

- Objectives
- Identify natural groupings among students (e.g., high, moderate, poor performers)
- Visualize clusters using PCA and t-SNE
- Evaluate clustering quality with silhouette score

- Visualizations
- PCA 2D scatter plots
- t-SNE plots with cluster annotations
- Cluster center summaries

- Requirements
- Python (3.x)
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- pandas
- seaborn
